        <h4>
            Amidst all the complexities involved in running an Online Fashion Store,
            retailers tend to forget that at the end of the day it’s about selling.
            They spend money on inventory, building a website, fulfillment, and
            marketing to bring people to their website, only to show them products
            with cookie-cutter descriptions. Gone are the days when a visitor would
            order from a website for convenience and lack of choice. Leveraging
            Fashion eCommerce Marketing services, thousands of new eCommerce
            websites are popping every day, hence customers today are rather spoiled
            for choice. If you don’t do a good job in describing your product,
            somebody else will. That’s why we get surprised when we see retailers
            who’re more worried about the color of the ‘Add to Cart’ button than the
            product description. The reason why product descriptions are so often
            ignored and not always up to the mark on online stores is that: Their
            inventory is too big They don’t have the marketing budget to write high
            quality product descriptions They decide to go with the default product
            description provided by the supplier They hire a copywriter who doesn’t
            have experience in writing for Fashion description The product
            descriptions are written to influence search engines, not the customers,
            etc
