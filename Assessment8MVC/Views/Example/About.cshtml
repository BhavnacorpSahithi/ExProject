        <pre>
     Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by 
     one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them.
     A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of 
    shoppers as recreational shoppers,[1] that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.
